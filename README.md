# MIDI-RGB-Lighting
Control individually addressable LEDs using the FastLED library and USB MIDI using the Teensy 3.6

See a demo and video of construction here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hBeVJ6QlaU

## Requirements: 

Requires a Teensy device. I am using a Teensy 3.6. I programmed it via Teensyduino configuring as a USBMIDI device:

The PSU must be rated for power required by your LED strips. Each LED with each color at full brightness (white) can be estimated to draw 50mA. 108 
LEDs as I have programmed has a current draw of 108 lights * 0.05 Amps/light = 5.4A. 5V * 5.4A = 27W minimum for the power supply you shoudl buy. You should get a PSU that can output a good margin more power than is required (although it will only supply as much power as is demanded from the lights).

You will require an Digital Audio Workstation to send MIDI control messages. To use the included template/example, you will need FL Studio (I'm using version 20)

## Quick Start: 

The Teensy will need to be connected as shown below:

In the code:
Enter the total number of RGB LEDs under the NUM_LEDs definition and enter the pin from which
data will be sent to the lights under the DATA_PIN definition.

Upload the code to the board, leave the usb cable connected, and then turn on the 5V PSU.

Start FL Studio and press play!


## Concepts: 

Void loop will write messages to the lights at a frequency of 1/33,333e-6s = ~30Hz
Between writes to the data line, the HSV of each light is determined by midi event handlers
OnNoteOn, OnNoteOff, and (most usually) OnControlChange. On Control change is used to directly
set the value of several global variables as described at the bottom. The global parameters are used
differently or ignored depending on the mode - the parameter with the most effect on how LEDs are displayed.
Several modes have been programmed - Their names are given in the OnControlChange function, but
the best way to figure out what they do is to try them out!

In order to make it more visually interesting, I've incorporated the concept of a foreground and
a background. We'll call them layers. If the foreground doesn't make use of all of the lights,
then the background will cover the rest. This way, you can control two sets of patterns simultaneously
and independently. It's possible to do more patterns than this, but having an foreground an background
seemed intuitive and  manageable.

Global variables are bytes since MIDI standard only allows numbers between 0 and 127 to be transmitted.
some variables don't make use of all 127 values, i.e. ffMode has 9 values - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
These variables generally control these aspects of the LEDs:

    Parameter   | MIDI Control # | Description
    ffHue       |       1        | foreground layer hue
    ffSat       |       2        | foreground layer saturation
    ffBright    |       3        | foreground layer brightness
    ffLedStart  |       4        | foreground layer start position of LED
    ffLedLength |       5        | foreground layer length of a line of LEDs
    ffMode      |       6        | foreground layer mode (0-8)

      // 4: back and forth
      // 5: Move startLED with each note on event

      // 8: Ocean waves
      // 9: Opposed Ocean waves

    cAmp        |       8        | foreground and background layer color Amplitude for use in color sinusoid mode (my favorite)
    bgMode      |       9        | background layer mode (0-2)
      //0: Flat Color background

## Controlling from FL Studio:
![Controlling from FL Studio](https://github.com/DigitallyRemastered/MIDI-RGB-Lighting/blob/main/images/FL%20GUI%20help.png)

1. Click on the Lights MIDI Channel to show the control knobs. You can right click the control knobs and click *Configure* to show that e.g. *sat* has *Controller* set to 2, so that the value of *sat* in Fl Studio is assigned to *ffSat* on the Teensy.

2. Ensure that the port is the same as what is configured for the MIDI device (Check MIDI settings by pressing F10)

3. You can access Foreground and Background controls on separate pages accessible by this dropdown

4. You can right click a control knob and select *create automation clip* to be able to automate that property temporally.
